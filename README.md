This is my trick to capture who person received my email but he haven't read yet.

in some case, i need to followup them by using other platform. In other hand, sometimes i used this trick to capture how many people interset with my information.

The complete tutorial i have explained on [Medium](https://akbarul.medium.com/cara-melihat-email-telah-dibaca-atau-belum-41dd925816b8) in Bahasa. Feel free to modify it. Greet me at omayib@gmail.com if you want to say thank you.

Lets drive our organization by data, data and data.
